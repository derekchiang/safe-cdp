            CDP is Collateral Debt Position in full. A CDP helps in generating a <br/>
            specific amount of DAI stablecoin (USD pegged tokens) against the <br/>
            collateral (which is ETH currently) to lock up in the CDP to secure the <br/>
            loan i.e. the DAI you generated.

            You can generate liquidity by generating DAI stablecoins without giving <br/>
            up ownerships of your collateral (in this case, your collateralised ETH) , <br/>
            making sure your CDP holds enough collateral to cover the value of the <br/>
            collateral ETH.

            Connect your wallet. Determine the amount of loan you want to borrow, <br/>
            then decide the amount of ETH you want to lock in the CDP, you <br/>
            generate the DAI stablecoins against the ETH you locked up, and spend <br/>
            them as you wish. You can pay back the DAI stablecoins when you no <br/>
            longer need the liquidity, together with stability price (which will be <br/>
            added to the overall debt), and then you can redeem the collateral you <br/>
            locked up.

            <Typography className="answer">
            Always make sure that the value of ETH locked up is always more than <br/>
            150% of the DAI stablecoins that youâ€™ve generated. Which means, you <br/>
            can only take DAI loan up to 66% of the total ETH collateral value in USD. <br/>
            If the value of the collateral comes near 66%, in this case you can add <br/>
            more collateral or pay back some of your debt. If the value of the issue / <br/>
            collateral ratio falls above 66% then your CDP will break i.e will be <br/>
            liquidated. This means that your collateral will be sold in order to cover <br/>
            the value of the DAI stablecoins you generated. Otherwise, any leftover <br/>
            collateral will be returned to your CDP, so you can redeem it.
